## Server Scripts

Files in this folder are operational or diagnostic utilities.

They are **not** part of the request-serving runtime path.

### Current intent

- `replay-pipeline-suite.ts`
- `replay-pipeline.ts`
- `replay-strategic-context-suite.ts`
- `validate-production-readiness-real.ts`

Use these only for:

- replay
- validation
- benchmarking
- diagnostics

Do not treat them as required production workflow steps.
If the application only works after manually running one of these scripts, that is a product/runtime bug and should be fixed in the server jobs or routes instead.
